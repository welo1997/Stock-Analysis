# üìà NASDAQ Index Stock Analysis (Learning Project)

This repository hosts a Python-based project focused on collecting, cleaning, and experimentally visualizing time-series data for the **NASDAQ Composite Index (IXIC)**.
This project served as a self-directed exercise to practice and reinforce fundamental data science skills using popular Python libraries.



## üöÄ Project Goal (Training Focus)

The primary objective of this project was not a definitive investment analysis, but rather a **hands-on training exercise** to master the following critical steps in a data science workflow:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Connecting to an external financial API to download raw stock data.
2.  **Data Storage:** Managing data persistently using the CSV format.
3.  **Data Manipulation:** Loading and processing time-series data using Pandas DataFrames.
4.  **Data Visualization:** Experimenting with various plot types to identify and visualize financial trends and patterns.



## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

| **Language** | Python | Core programming language. |
| **Data Acquisition** | `yfinance` | Downloaded historical stock data from **Yahoo! Finance**. |
| **Data Handling** | **Pandas** | Created, manipulated, and cleaned the data within a DataFrame structure. |
| **Visualization** | **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (or similar) | Used for experimental plotting of trends and metrics. |
| **Data Storage** | `.csv` | Saved the clean, prepared data for future use. |
